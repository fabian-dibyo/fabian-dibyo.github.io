Hello world. I am a programmer and tutor born in the late 90's. I have recently done my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science & Engineering from BRAC University. My interests are in Python Programming, Machine Learning, Deep learning and Optimization Algorithms. Apart from academics, I am a cinephile and like to enjoy various genres of music.
